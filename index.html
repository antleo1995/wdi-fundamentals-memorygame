		<h2>Instructions</h2>

		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

		<h3>Why my game?</h3>

		<p ID="mygame">My game is the best in the world:
		I spent hours and hours pouring sweat banging out code whilst being roasted over hot flames. Not because I had to, but becuase why do anything the easy way. I also used 5 foot long poles to type out my code. I slept a total of 8 hours over 2 weeks as I poured over this project. There is also quite literally a small piece of my soul in card 3. The code is well hidden, so don't look, and don't ask. If I reveal that code I am under obligation of the crown to gouge out your eyes so that you may not see another line of code in all your life.<br><i>All of this material is satire and copyrighted, so feel free to use it as you please.</i>
